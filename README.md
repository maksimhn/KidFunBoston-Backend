# KidFun Boston!
This app provides parents living in the greater Boston area to learn about fun activities for them and their kids to do in and around Boston. The frontend was created using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX calls to the backend, HTML, and CSS.  The backend was created using Ruby on Rails.

Frontend App Features:

* Created from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use of AJAX to communicate with the backend
* Separation of concerns
* Showing and hiding divs, simulating multiple pages, even though the app consists of only one page (or maybe I'll using scrolling animation instead)
* Use of a modal, for registration and logging in
* Extensive use of CSS, especially to (put something here)
* jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
* Animation and hover effects (if I end up doing this)

Backend App Features:

* Use of XXX gem for handling the uploading of images to Amazon S3
* Use of ImageMagick for processing of images and their respective thumbnails
